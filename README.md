# MiniTMS Project (Mini Transportation Management System Project)
Old Pain Points
  - There is no proof of the exact time when a driver picks up and drops off goods. Because the driver will send a confirmation for pick-up and drop-off at any time they want, logistics admins must follow.
  - Pick-up and drop-off times from the driver are not real-time.

New Solutions
  - Make an application that allows drivers to submit evidence of pickup and drop-off goods, including real-time times, to the operating database.
  - It takes no more than 2 minutes to complete the application loop.

I used Retool (backend workflow, graphic interface, and frontend software development).
